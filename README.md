# Computer Vision - MYY046

This repository contains the programming assignment completed for the **Computer Vision (MYY046)** course at the University of Ioannina, during the Winter semester of 2024–2025.

## Contents

- `assignment.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to all given exercises.
- `assignment.pdf`: The exported PDF version of the notebook for submission.

## Description

The assignment focuses on two main topics:
- **Traditional Machine Learning Techniques**:  
  Implementations using Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Principal Component Analysis with kNN).
- **Deep Learning Techniques**:  
  Implementation and training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using PyTorch, including a Linear Classifier and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST dataset.

Each solution includes detailed comments, theoretical explanations, and visualizations such as confusion matrices and visualization of learned weights.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- PyTorch

## Notes

- The exercises were completed individually according to the course policy.
- No third-party code was used unless explicitly allowed (libraries mentioned in the assignment).
- All code is heavily commented and structured for clarity.
